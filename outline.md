•	What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?

I want to make a website to promote my music and also serve as a domain that branches out to all my other platforms. The website will have information about the songs I’ve made, about me and will also have links to my other platforms. I want the functionality of the website to be more abstract than any other website, as I want to execute an artistry that aligns with my online persona and music. One theme I want to incorporate is the mix of multi-media art and coding, which I plan to do by using hover-on and scroll animations built from frame by frame multi-media photography and art. I think it’d be cool to explore more abstract ways of designing user interfaces as I want the website to feel like an experience and an art piece itself, instead of only just serving the purpose of providing information. My website will serve the purpose of providing links and information about me as an artist, but will also do it in a way that lifts up my persona as an artist and a push a narrative that aligns with the eventual goal of my music. 

•	Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?

I chose to work on this project because it gives me an opportunity to apply my computer science path to my passion in music, which I don’t get the opportunity to often. Having a website for my music allows me to have a place which my audience can explore aspects about my music and me that I may not have in other places. It can serve as a “portfolio” for my all my musical works and gives me a chance to possibly dive deeper into the meanings of my songs. Additionally, my abstract vision for this website allows me to explore ‘unconventional’ means of coding, further pushing my understanding of HTML, CSS, Java and any other tools I use.

•	Who is the target audience of this app? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).

The target demographic for my music is a younger generation(teens to late 20s), so the target demographic for my website would be that as well. The vision of the website I have is in the format of a computer website, but I’d love to explore how to adapt it for phone dimensions, something I’ve never tried before. Scroll animations is the biggest thing I want to incorporate into my website, so I wonder if it will easily be adapted for phones? I only briefly have coded wesbites, but I know that adapting websites for phones isn’t the most difficult task in the world, but I wonder how hover-on animations will work especially. I’d love for my audience to most likely discover my music first, and then click off into my website and further learn who I am as an artist! I do not have a target occupation demographic in mind, as any occupation can enjoy music. 

•	What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your app?

Currently, the platforms associated with my music are Instagram, Spotify and Apple Music. Instagram and Spotify have a “biography” feature for an account, but no feature to really dive deep into more information about a song or to display extended information about an artist. The goal of my final project is not only to solve this problem but providing a space for me to add any pictures, audios and information I want, but to be able to present in a way that I have complete control in and a way that aligns with my persona as an artist. One specific media I wanted to add to the website is “behind the scenes” videos or videos of me preforming live, specifically animated to play when a mouse hovers over. My target audience benefits from this website as they can learn more about me as an artist, and if I can successfully execute my vision for this website, will further push my persona as an artist! Additionally, it serves a place to place links to all my other accounts and platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music and Instagram, which you listen to my music and follow my life and know behind the scenes information.
